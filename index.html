        <h2>Soil Grade</h2>
        <p>The players will be able to grow and harvest crops on their land by planting seeds within the soil.</p>
        <p>There are 5 grades of soil playable, with 1 being normal to 5 being the best. All land plots will start with a soil grade of 1.</p>
        <p>The soil grade quality can be increased using fertilizer if it is less than the maximum soil grade of 5.</p>
        <p>Each crop will have a (base) number of growth cycles which represents the time the crop takes from being planted to being ready to harvest. Each growth cycle represents 24 hours in the real-world. However, time in the Cornucopias Metaverse runs different to the real world and so we are representing growth in cycles to avoid any time confusions.</p>
        <p>You can upgrade the soil grade of a land plot throughout the seasons if it is less than the maximum soil grade of 5.</p>
        <p>If the crop is not watered regularly it will take longer to grow or even worse it may die. Sprinklers can be used to automatically water crops.</p>
        <p>The grade of the soil may influence the growth speed of some crops. The base level for each crop represents the length of time it takes a crop to grow if planted on a farm with a soil grade of 1. If the soil grade is higher the crop may grow quicker as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Soil Grade 1 - the crop may grow at the same rate as stated by the crops base level.</li>
            <li>Soil Grade 2 - the crop may grow faster than the crops at Soil Grade 1.</li>
            <li>Soil Grade 3 - the crop may grow faster than the crops at Soil Grade 2.</li>
            <li>Soil Grade 4 - the crop may grow faster than the crops at Soil Grade 3.</li>
            <li>Soil Grade 5 - the crop may grow faster than the crops at Soil Grade 4.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The grade of the soil may deteriorate over time if it is not maintained.</p>
        <p>Some rarer crops will only be able to be grown on higher grades of soil.</p>
        <p>There will be crops that can be grown every season and some that are only capable of being grown in 1 or more seasons. These will be clearly explained in the crop details page which will be added to the COPIWiki.</p>
